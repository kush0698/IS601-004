<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Was not able to see deployment in actions, and when I got it<br>I had some errors, I corrected the errors and re-commit the changes and<br>pushed it again. Then was able to get a successful build and deploy<br>the app successfully.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> What can you tell me about docker? Describe the various steps needed to get an app ran inside a docker container in your own words</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Docker is a popular containerization technology used to package and run applications in<br>an isolated and portable environment.&nbsp;To run an app inside a Docker container, you<br>need to define the <br>application environment in a Dockerfile, build a Docker image,<br>create a <br>Docker container, and verify the container is running. Optionally, you <br>can<br>push the built Docker image to a Docker registry to share it with<br><br>others or deploy it to production.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> What is Heroku? Why do you feel it was chosen for this class?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Heroku is a cloud platform that allows developers to deploy, manage, and<br> scale<br>applications without having to worry about infrastructure. It <br>supports multiple programming languages and<br>provides a range of add-ons <br>and tools to simplify development workflows. I think<br>it was chosen for this class, because it works good with github, has<br>good workflow, since we are working with github, heroku is better option to<br>deploy apps and various programs.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> What is flask? List a few things you learned about it</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that enables developers <br>to quickly<br>build web applications. It provides tools for routing, <br>request handling, and template rendering,<br>and is extensible through a <br>variety of third-party extensions. Some things I learned<br>about Flask <br>include its simplicity, flexibility, and suitability for small to <br>medium-sized projects.<br>It also supports both SQL and NoSQL databases and<br> can be easily integrated<br>with other technologies such as Docker and <br>Heroku. Additionally, Flask&#39;s built-in development server<br>and debugger <br>make it easy to test and debug applications during the development<br><br>process.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> What is the difference between a Dockerfile and a Github Action .yml file?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>A Dockerfile is used to define the environment and dependencies for an <br>application<br>to run inside a Docker container, while a GitHub Actions <br>.yml file is<br>used to define the workflows and actions that automate <br>software development processes, such<br>as building, testing, and <br>deploying. In other words, a Dockerfile is used to<br>create a container <br>image, while a GitHub Actions .yml file is used to<br>automate the process <br>of building and deploying that image to production.<br></p><br></td></tr>
